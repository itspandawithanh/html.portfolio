<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Phanda Deenesh Mushwana, a 29-year-old IT Technician with 7 years of experience in the tech world and an aspiring full-stack developer. Basically, if it has circuits, code, or the potential to break at the worst possible time, I’ve probably dealt with it..</p>

<p>When I’m not troubleshooting my way through digital chaos, you’ll find me indulging in my love for movies, music, and binge-worthy series. I’m also a certified adrenaline junkie—whether it's traveling to new places or seeking out heart-racing adventures, I’m all in.</p>

<p>I would say that I am witty, funny, and equipped with a generous dose of sarcasm, I bring humor to everything I do. However, fair warning—my personality is an acquired taste. Some love it, some take a while to adjust, and some just quietly exit the chat. I can be an introvert at times, so don’t be surprised if I occasionally retreat into my tech-filled fortress of solitude.</p>

<p>Let’s connect! Whether it’s tech, movies, or extreme sports, I’m always up for a good conversation—just don’t expect small talk; I prefer deep dives or nothing at all.</p>
